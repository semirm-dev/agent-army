# Agent Army

A modular library of coding standards, workflows, and agent prompts for AI-assisted development. Includes a Go CLI (`army`) to manage specs, resolve dependencies, and generate platform-specific output for Claude Code or Cursor.

> NOTE: **Caution!!** Always backup your current destination setup because `bootstrap` will always do remove-all-existing -> generate new. Test in a safe place (destination) first.

## What's Inside

### Rules (`spec/rules/`)

Coding standards and best practices. Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Scoped as `universal` (all languages) or `language-specific` (e.g., `go/patterns`). Rules define **what** good code looks like — naming, error handling, security, testing, etc.

Examples: `api-design`, `security`, `go/patterns`, `typescript/testing`

### Skills (`spec/skills/`)

Structured workflows and decision trees. Also markdown with frontmatter. Skills define **how** to accomplish tasks — designing APIs, setting up caching, hardening security. Skills declare `uses_rules` to reference the rules they depend on.

Examples: `api-designer`, `caching-strategy`, `go/coder`, `react/tester`

### Agents (`spec/agents/`)

Prompt templates for specialized AI roles. Grouped by language/domain in subdirectories, with cross-cutting agents at the root. Platform-agnostic — no tool names, model references, or IDE-specific paths. Agents declare `uses_skills` (which transitively bring rules) and `uses_plugins` for extensions.

Examples: `go/coder`, `typescript/reviewer`, `python/tester`, `infrastructure/builder`, `arch-reviewer`

## How They Relate

```
Rules       → foundational standards         (the "what")
Skills      → task workflows that use rules  (the "how")
Agents      → specialized roles that invoke skills and follow rules  (the "who")
```

```

  security                       go/coder                    typescript/reviewer
  go/patterns                    react/tester                python/tester
```

## CLI (`army`)

The Go CLI lives in `army/`. Build it with `make build`, then use it via `make` targets or directly as `army/army <command>`.

## Make Commands

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make help` | Show all available targets |
| `make build` | Build the Go CLI binary |
| `make test` | Run Go tests with race detection |
| `make manifest` | Scan `spec/` frontmatter and regenerate `manifest.json`. Resolves `uses_rules` and `delegates_to` transitively, including rules inherited from skills |
| `make edit-deps` | Interactively add or remove dependency entries (`uses_rules`, `uses_skills`, `uses_plugins`, `delegates_to`) on any spec file. Rewrites YAML frontmatter in-place, then auto-regenerates the manifest |
| `make resolve-deps` | Validate all dependency references across `spec/`. Detect and remove redundant `uses_rules` and `delegates_to` entries covered by transitive dependencies |
| `make new-rule` | Scaffold a new rule with interactive prompts |
| `make new-skill` | Scaffold a new skill with interactive prompts |
| `make new-agent` | Scaffold a new agent with interactive prompts |
| `make bootstrap` | Generate model-specific rules, skills, and agents (output in `.build/`) |
| `make sync` | Install all plugins and skills listed in `PLUGINS_AND_SKILLS.md` |

## Manifest (`manifest.json`) - for now unused index file

Auto-generated index of all rules, skills, and agents. Each entry lists:

- **name** — identifier (e.g., `go/patterns`, `api-designer`, `go/coder`)
- **scope** — `universal` or `language-specific`
- **languages** — applicable languages (for language-specific entries)
- **uses_rules** — resolved dependencies (transitive — includes indirect dependencies)
- **path** — file path relative to the repo root

Agent entries additionally include: **role**, **access**, **uses_skills**, **uses_plugins**, **delegates_to**.

Regenerate with `make manifest`.

## Bootstrap Output (`.build/`)

### Claude Code

`make bootstrap` and pick Claude Code, generates platform-specific output in `.build/claude/` (adjustable):

- `CLAUDE.md` — orchestrator with agent definitions, safety constraints, and plugin references
- `agents/`, `skills/`, `rules/` — resolved spec files ready for Claude Code consumption
- `settings.json` — Claude Code settings from `spec/claude/settings.json`

### Cursor

`make bootstrap` and pick Cursor, generates platform-specific output in `.build/cursor/` (adjustable):

- `AGENTS.md` — orchestrator with agent definitions, safety constraints, and plugin references
- `agents/`, `skills/`, `rules/` — resolved spec files ready for Cursor consumption

## TODO
- [ ] Get rid of rules/, focus on skills/ and agents/ only
- [ ] Adjust skills/ output to be model agnostic (supported by all)
- [ ] Favor claude's skill creator to create new skills, suggest based on project and tech stack
- [ ] Simplify claude.md and agents.md (remove references to agents, skills, rules...), be as generic as possible
- [ ] Cleanup agents/, keep only absolutely necessary ones
